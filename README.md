PawParazzi is an embedded system that allows you to stay connected with your pet even when youâ€™re away! PawParazzi is a smart food bowl that detects when your pet is eating and captures a picture. The photo captures of your furry friend are available to see in the PawParazzi mobile app.

The goal of PawParazzi was to demonstrate full-stack system design. The Arduino UNO, ultrasonic sensor, and ESP32-CAM are integrated with Firebase cloud storage to capture, store, and display images in real-time on our React Native mobile app.

 ## What We Learned
- Interfacing with various microcontrollers (Arduino UNO, ESP32-CAM) and interpreting sensor data from the ultrasonic sensor
- Establishing communication between microcontroller units
- Integrating hardware components with Firebase cloud service for real-time data transfer
- Mobile application development using React Native; creation of an image carousel to display dynamic content from Firebase
